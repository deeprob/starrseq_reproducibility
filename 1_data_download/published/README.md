# Published datasets description and usage
We reanalyzed datasets from existing STARR-seq studies in order to assess them for their data quality control steps and compare them to our in-house generated data. Datasets from the following studies were reanalyzed.

1. Johnson et al: "Human genome-wide measurement of drug-responsive regulatory activity.", Nat Commun, 2018 Dec 21;9(1):5317.
2. Wang et al: "High-resolution genome-wide functional dissection of transcriptional regulatory regions and nucleotides in human.", Nat Commun, 2018 Dec 19;9(1):5380.
3. Lee et al: "STARRPeaker: uniform processing and accurate identification of STARR-seq active regions.", Genome Biol 21, 298 (2020).

The datasets downloaded from each study along with their respective download scripts is present in study specific directories.
